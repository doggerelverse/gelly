 the 

DungeonMaster
 - singleton
 - should act as a state machine

- dungeonmaster should always be in the state of processing a turn

- character objects have a queue of actions
- when the character is asked to perform an action on it's turn, the queue is updated
  - this should take place inside character.mind
- if the character mind has an attached controller, what happens?
  - the caller is told to wait
  - the game loop continues, each iter. asking gm to take a turn
  - eventually (one hopes) the player enters an action, which updates the related character 
    objects action queue
  - the player character has the ability to place the dm on hold, which is only reversable with
    the activation of the "take turn" button
