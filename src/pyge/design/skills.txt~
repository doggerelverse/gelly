Skills


Overview:
  Skills are an abstract measure of proficiency in a given area. All characters cultivate a set 
  of skills throughout their lifetimes. This means that characters can both increase a given 
  skills relative level of proficiency, and learn new skills.
  Learning and improving skills is the primary means of character progression available to 
  players.


Skillset
A characters set of skills (or skillset) represents everything that the character has actively
developed a proficiency in. There is no limit to the size of a given characters skillset, but
there are limits on how many skills can be active at a given time. These limits are dependent on
the type of skill being discussed; combat skills, trade skills etc.


Skill
An individual skill is an abstract measure of a character's proficiency at performing a single 
task, or a set of related tasks.
Examples:
  Slash Skill: an attack skill used when making a slashing attack with a weapon.
the slash skill is used when attempting to make a slashing attack, regardless of weapon type, eg
axe, mace, sword, etc.
  Carpentry Skill: a measure of a characters skill at crafting items from wood
general woodworking skill, used for everything from making a wooden shield, to a post and beam
house

Skills have a level between 1 and 10. 

0: A skill level of zero corresponds to having no particular proficiency in this area. Interestin
   things can happen if you attempt to use skills you don't have. Usually in the form of hurting
   yourself.
1: Beginner, with no particular apparent aptitude at the task. You've barely mastered the use of
   the relevant words involved in what your doing, let alone the task itself.
2: Novice, you are starting to gain the hang of how things work, and can complete tasks related
   to this skill without outright ridicule. You're still really, really bad, though.
3: Apprentice, you've mastered the basics. In terms of tradegoods, a skilled salesperson might
   even be able to convince someone to buy an item you've crafted.
5: Journeyman, you've done more that mastered the basics, but much of the complexity related to 
   the skill as well. In terms of combat skills, a level 5 attack is cleanly executed and deadly,
   with perhaps minor issues of style. In terms of tradeskills, your skill in this area is highly
   marketable, and goods you produce are considered of good quality. Anyone from a soldier to a
   knight would consider himself well equipped if he was carrying equipment made by a jounerman 
   smith into battle. Although the knight most likely has more of it.
7: Master, you're skill is rare and valuable. Attack skills performed by a master are executed 
   with a style and grace only matched with their lethality. Items crafted by a master are of 
   excellent quality, and prized by powerful Lords and Princes. No task associated with a skill 
   is beyond the ability of a Master, although a Master would consider some tasks difficult and/or
   dangerous.
9: GrandMaster, A city would consider itself lucky if a grandmaster practiced his craft there.
   Whole schools form around grandmasters, and a whole industry can form around such a school. 
   The goods that a GrandMaster produces are of the highest quality, and are usually commissioned.
   A sword crafted by a grandmaster would be saught after by Kings, Emperors, and Grand Master 
   fencers. Few can appreciate the difference in the work of a grandmaster, but a grandmasters
   work is considered invaluable to those who can.
10: Legendary, A Kingdom would consider a craftsman of legendary skill a national treasure. An
    enemy would consider a Legendary warrior's name as synonymous with death. Few have the time
    or the potential to build a skill to legendary.
    Items made by legendary craftsman fall into the same quality bracket as the works made by
    grandmasters. What separates a GrandMaster and a Legendary craftsman is a lifetime of 
    innovation and dedication.
