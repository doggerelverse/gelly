Strength - measure of maximum force that can be applied to a mass

This is tricky, and there is plenty of room for criticism. Short of a full body biomechanical
simulation, this is meant to serve as an adequate approximation. 
A punch, spear thrust, or sword swing are all full body activities, and demonstrably different in
form. For the purposes of this approximation, the acceleration and force of a boxers punch(1).
We take the measurements from the experiments as representative of an average ability of a well
trained (but not a global human maximum) athelete to accelerate a mass in a thrusting motion.
Data 
- SLBF: Sum of Lower Body Forces

Interpretation
 A straight punch has a final velocity of ~10m/s using maximal force
 A hook punch has a final velocity of ~20m/s using maximal force

Thrust:
5000 kg*m/s^2 
What if we pretend that a spear thrust has the same impact force as a punch?
How do we modify for mass?

WORK: joules, work done by F over distance
   work done by 1 Newton over 1 m = joule
