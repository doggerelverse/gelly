Combat System Schemes


there are a variety of possibilities which can be imlemented in the current system with little
to no modification of the game engine. Which one will be chosen largely depends on how well it
models reality, as well as how much fun it is.


Scheme 1
  Overview: actions are performed during a characters turn, with the turn ending once a maximum
            number of actions has been performed. Actions have a fixed energy cost, usually
            proportional to the power of the action.
    Major Action: actions which take considerable time and/or preparation, such as attacking,
                  movement, reloading a ranged weapon, etc
    Minor Action: actions which take negligible time, such as stance changes, activating 
                  abilities, target changes, etc
  Implementation:
   A character would be able to perform a maximum number of actions on his/her turn, 
   such as:
    method 1: One Major action or two minor actions
    method 2: One Major action and two minor actions
    method 3: One Major action and unlimited minor actions



Scheme 2
  Overview: actions are performed during a characters turn, with the turn ending once a character
            has performed a single action or chosen to end his/her turn. Actions have a fixed
            energy cost, usually proportional to the actions power.
    Action: an attack, spellcast, etc
  
  Implementation:
    A character chooses which of his abilities to use on his/her turn. Almost every ability
    constitutes an action, with some abilities affecting the next major action used.


Scheme 3
  Overview: actions are performed during a character's turn, with the turn ending once a character
            has performed a single action or chosen to end the turn. Actions have a variable
            energy cost, determined by the character.
    Action: an ability with a minimun energy cost (threshold) and (sometimes) a maximum energy
            cost.

  Implementation:
  
  Pros: -tactical component of not spending too much energy during a turn, leaving enough for 
         defense

Scheme 4
  Overview: actions are performed during a character's turn, with the turn ending once a character
            has run out of energy or chosen to end the turn. Actions have a fixed energy cost, but
            any number of actions can be performed during a single turn so long as the character
            has energy left to spend.
    Action: an ability with a fixed energy cost

  Implementation:
    Turn: A character continues to perform actions until he/she runs out of energy or chooses to 
          end her turn.
    defense: any unused energy from a characters turn is available for defense actions during the
             opponent(s) turn.

  Pros: -tactical component of not spending too much energy during a turn, leaving enough for 
         defense

  Cons:-careful balancing required to ensure that a given actions' energy cost is not too low,
        otherwise repeated uses in a single turn by a high level character might break balance
       -careful balance of character level:energy pool ratio. Too low, and HL characters die 
        easily to lower level characters, too high and HL characters are unbeatable
       -without a limit on the number of actions performed, may (would) allow high level 
        characters to wipe out whole groups of low level characters in a single turn
