Armour
  worn by characters to protect against attacks
  A piece of armour is described by the following stats:
  Coverage: percentage of the body covered by the piece of armour
  Flexibility: how well the armour transfers force to the wearer, as a percentage of the force
               applied. The lower the better. Not used if an attack penetrates the armour
  Toughness: how difficult the armour is to penetrate
  Mass: how heavy the armour is
  Encumberance: how much of the mass is felt by the wearer

  second pass
  zones: areas of the body, each area will have its own coverage statistic, which is used when
         that area is targted, and is irrelevant otherwise, eg a character wearing a full helm
         and padded armour is well protected from attacks targetting the head, but is vulnerable
         elsewhere.


Examples: how do we model various armours with our 3 stat system

- coverage is easy, how much of the given region does the armour cover? A skullcap covers less 
  than a full helm, a breastplate covers less that a breastplate with backplate, a maille shirt
  covers less than a maille hauberk, etc
- flexibility and toughness
    - plate armour: 
       -high toughness, low flexibility, hight mass, low (relative) encumberance
    - maille armour:
       -high toughness, high flexibility, high mass, high encumberance
    - linothorax:
       -medium toughness, low flexibility, low mass, low encumberance
    - brigandine:
       - medium toughness, medium flexibility, low mass, low encumberance
    - leather:
       -low toughness, low flexibility, low mass, low encumberance
    



Penetrating Armour
 - all armour has gaps
 - all armour transmits force to the wearer
 - all armour can be penetrated given enough force

so, to damage an armoured opponent, you may:
 - attack around the armour, in gaps and areas of poor coverage
 - attack through the armour, trasmiting force with blunt attacks
 - penetrate the armour





armour types
  - composite - brigandine, studded leather, etc, usually a mixture of light metal plating, 
    	        leather, ring armour, and even cloth (linothorax)
		
  - ring      - made from thousands of interlocking rings, with varying degrees of protective
    	      	effectiveness. 

  - plate     - metal plates

cloth on metal
  brigandine, coat of plates
   cloth garment with metal plates sewn or rivited inside it

metal on cloth
  scale armour
  splint armour
  lamellar armour small plates (lames) which are laced together in parallel rows. Lamellar armour evolved from scale armour,[1] from which it differs by not needing a backing for the scales. It is made from pieces of 




Sharp weapons:
  eg katana
  do a fine job against most cloth/leather armour types, but are useless against metal armour
  like mail and plate
  eg longsword
  do an alright job against most cloth/leather armour types, transfer massive blunt against
  flexible armour like mail, but are mostly useless against plate. However, alternate stances,
  such as half-sword stance, greatly increase potential armour penetration
  how to model: 

weapons have 3 damage types
 cutting: used when slashing, directly related to how sharp of an edge the weapon can hold, and
          how well the weapon can be used in a slashing motion
 piercing: used when stabbing, directly related to how shapor of a tip the weapon has, and haw
           well the weapon can be used in a stabbing motion
 blunt: used for blunt weapons, or when weapon fails to penetrate armour, directly relates to the
        mass of a weapon

so a katana has great cutting damage, but terrible piercing and terrible blunt
longsword has good cutting, decent piercing, and decent blunt
an estoc has negligible cutting, excellent piercing and good blunt
a spear has no cutting, excellent piercing and good blunt
a round mace has no cutting, no piercing, but great blunt
