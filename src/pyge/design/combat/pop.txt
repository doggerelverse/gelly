Places of Power:

Places of Power are proceduraly generated or statically defined locations on the game board which
allow for the enhancement of normal actions and abilities, or unique moves and abilities.
PoPs can be in relation to another game object, such as a character.


The primary attribute for identifying PoPs is perception

Martial PoP
  flank: attacking an opponent from the side
  rear:  attacking an opponent from behind
  ledges: anything which provides a height advantage, attacking an opponent from above
Magical PoP
  Weigh Lines, Nodes, dimensional intersections, etc
  nodes: concentrations of magical power, interfaces to access additional power. A magic user
         positioned on a node can use the nodes power to enhance his own spell casting
  weigh lines: lines of force connecting to nodes. Nodes may occure where weigh lines cross. A
               magic user positioned on or near a weigh line can enhance a spell centered on a 
               node connected to this weigh line. A spell enhanced in this way will have an effect
               centered at a connected node (not anywhere within range). This can be used to 
               attack enemies near a node, or enemies 
  
  

  - can be used to enhance magic cast by positioning oneself on the node, until the node is
    exhausted
  - can be used from a distance to incredible effect, ie remotely detonating the nodes power,
    requires proximity to the a weigh line attached to the node
  - can be used to effect multiple enemies by sending spells through a nodes connected weigh lines


DESIGN: interaction between magic users
magic users on adjacent nodes
magic user on node, another on connected weigh line
