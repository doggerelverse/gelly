Parry
  - loosely defined as any action which deflects an incoming attack with a weapon or shield
    - this includes, blocks, deflections, redirections, etc
  - potentially allows for a followup attack called a riposte during opponents turn


Scheme:
Several Schemes for parrying are possible

  -Physical
    models the physical interaction between the weapons given modelled stats of weapon
    acceleration, final speed, materials, wielder strength etc to a level of fidelity which is
    judged to be adequately realistic without being overly complicated
    Potential Mechanics
     parrying involves defending against an incoming attack with the characters 
      equiped weapon
       this involves a weapon speed vs weapon speed comparison
        ie how fast the attackers weapon is moving vs how fast the defender can move
	 his own weapon.
	 - a parry can only begin once the opponents weapon is within the effective reach
	   of the defenders weapon
	    - various passive and active skills can change this
  -Abstract
    models physical interaction, but takes into account the abstract stats of characters, such as
    "weapon skill" and "attack energy". These abstractions allow us to simplify combat modelling
    by appealing to blackboxes representing physical models. These black boxes include the afore-
    mentioned "skill". Other such stats might include "target number", which models the difficulty
    of attempting a given task. The Target Number of a parrying a rapier with a short club might
    be on the high end of the scale, while a rapier-rapier parry has a low Target Number.
