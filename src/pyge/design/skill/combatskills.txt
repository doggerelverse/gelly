Martial Attack Abilities
  abilities which physically attack a target with a weapon
  the astute observer will note that many of the basic martial abilities have nothing to say
  about the damaged they deal. This is because damage dealt is a weapon function of energy, 
  and wielder strength.

  Slash: basic cutting attack, many varieties exist, volumes written on form and 
         technique, but the basics are essentially the same
         -level: 1-5
         -threshold: 2
         -base damage: swing
         -max energy: level+3
         -damage: dependent on weapon
  Thrust: basic piercing attack, master fencers are known settle disagreements on proper form with
          live demonstrations. 
          -level: 1-5
          -threshold: 2
          -base damage: thrust
          -max energy: level+3
  Strike: downward cutting attack from an overhead stance
          -level: 1-5
          -threshold: 2 if in high guard, 3 otherwise
          -max energy: level+4
          -+1 effective energy against parry&dodge
  Spin: attack made with a 2-handed weapon where one hand is pulled, the other pushed. This is
         generally only possible with polearms. It has the advantage of being fast, with a very
         short minimum range, but at the cost of half of the weapons normal reach
         -level: 1-5
         -threshold: 2
         -max energy: level+1/4*str
         -reach: weapon reach * 1/2
  Dual Strike: strike simultaneously with 2 equipped weapons. High energy attack which is becomes
               very difficult for the target to parry or dodge
               -level:1-5
               -threshold: 4
               -max energy: level+8, split between both weapons
               -+2*(number of equiped weapons-opponents weapons) to effective energy against
                parry
               -only useable while dual wielding
  Weapon Strike: strike an opponent's weapon followed by a quick attack, in an attempt to push the
                 defender's weapon out of position, making parrying more difficult. A weapon
                 strike is an essential skill when your opponent has *priority*
                 -level: 1-5
                 -threshold: 3
                 -max energy: level+4
                 -+2*(number of equiped weapons-opponents weapons) to effective energy against 
		  parry&dodge*
                 -if blocked, attacker gains *priority*
                 -(-1) to range penalty, to a minimum of 0
  Feint: strike at the opponent, changing target midswing.
         -level: 1-5
         -threshold: 4
         -max energy: level+6
  Double Attack: attack twice, in rapid succession. The second attack is generally easier to
                 parry or dodge. Each attack is itself another skill.
                 -level: 1-5
                 -threshold: 2
                 -max enegy: both of the chosen skills must have there threshold payed, and work 
		             exactly as described
                 -the second attack suffers a -2 penalty to parry/dodge
  Momentum: 
  Grab: attempt to grab an opponents weapon, either with a grab-capable weapon, or a bare fist.
        -level: 1-5
        -threshold: 2
        -max energy: skill level+1/2*strength
        -if a grab capable weapon is equipped (swordbreaker) that weapon is used, otherwise, bare
         hand is used
        -if bare hand is used the target weapon is edged, an armour penetration is calculated 
         againsnt the attackers hand armour as if the target struck the attacker on the hand with
         e=energy of grab**
  Hook: attempt to grab an opponent, either with a hook-capable weapon, or with bare hands
        -level: 1-5
        -threshold: 2
        -max energy: skill level + 1/2*strength
        -Halberds and other weapons capable of hooking an opponent typically have bonuses, but 
         this is not always the case.
  Shove: bodily push an opponent away. This skill is very useful when an opponent has priority,
         but you have a weapon with greater reach.
         -level: 1-5
         -threshold: 2
         -max energy: skill level + 1/2*strength
         -weapon: hands are used unless a weapon capable of a shove is equipped. Swords are 
                  typically not capable of shoving, while polearms and shields are.
         -defense: a shove cannot be parried, but it can be dodged or blocked. If dodged, the
                   attacker must make an agility check or is considered off-balance
                   dodge: attacker shove skill+str+energy <= defender dodge skill+agi+energy
                   block: attacker shove skill+str+energy <= defender dodge skill+str+energy
  Attack Move: attack while moving, can be used in an attempt to move into occupied tiles
               -level: 1-5
               -threshold: 4+weapon penalties+movement penalties
               -max energy:is an attempt to force your opponent to move back
   

  Tackle: attempt to bring an opponent to the ground.
          -level: 1-5
          -threshold: 2
          -max energy: skill level
          

*if Weapon strike is attempted by a dual wielding character (sword/shield, sword/sword, etc) 
 against a single wielding opponent (spear, greatsword, etc), Weapon strike gains +2 against
 attepmts to dodge and parry. If weapon strike is attempted by a triple wielding character
 (3 armed koala or something), the effective energy against dodge and parry is +4, etc.
**grabbing a sharp weapon with an unarmoured or lightly armoured hand is a great way to earn the
  nickname "Five Fingers"


example
- Character A uses a level 2 slash skill against character D. The skill has a threshold of 2, 
  damage of 2, max damage of 3, and max energy of 5.
- A uses 5 energy points for the ability, the maximum challenge rating possible for this level 2 
  skill. The challenge rating to defend against most skills is equal to the total energy used.
- D has a level 3 parry skill set to defend against attacks.
