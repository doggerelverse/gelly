Skill System


Target Number=Challenge Rating
  the difficulty of a given task


- for many activated abilities, the target number is considered equal to the level of the skill
  being attempted, that is, provided you are trained in the skill, using it is consistently
  possible. These self contained skills are usually activated abilities, such as attacks and
  spells.

- other actions have target numbers considerably different from the skill. One example is 
  rock climbing. The target number needed to climb a given rockface is dependent on the rockface
  itself. A given mountain path or hill may have a challenge rating of 5. This means that anyone
  who can walk can successfully climb the face. A steep, gravelly hill may have a challenge rating
  of 15 or 16. Your mountaneering skill is subtracted from the challenge rating, leaving an 
  energy cost. This cost is considered to be a "per distance" cost, as in, cost for moving on
  this type of slope for a single round of combat. This means that a player must have a certain
  energy capacity equal or greater than the challenge rating of the slope - his movement skill.
