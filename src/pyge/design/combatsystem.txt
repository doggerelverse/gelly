combat system

two actors, attacker, defender

attacker attacks
 attack is physically analyzed, 4 outcomes
   - parry - deflect with potential counter attack
   - dodge - physically move out of the way
   - block - absorbs the blunt force with weapon
   - hit   - strikes the defender

in the first three cases,
  - the attacker expends a certain amount of energy, determined by the action
  - the defender expends a certain amount of energy, determined by the reaction
in the last case,
  - hit : the armour of the character must now take the brunt of the blow, damage is 
          calculated based on how the armour interacts with the weapon
	  - 





last stand
  an ability of pc's and equivalent mobs, prevents being one-shotted, but incures serious cost









how combat will be fought
 flinch,offbalance,knockdown

- an attacker knocks down his opponent
- this typically takes two actions, unless the opponent is much weaker than the attacker

- knocked down opponent is highly vulnerable to attack, 
  - last stand dodge is very expensive
  - likely to suffer serious wounds
  






types of abilities

cause a flinch
bypass armour - an attack which attempts to wound the target directly by targetting gaps in an opponents armour




Armour
armour has a variety of stats
coverage
  - statistic of the character wearing armour.
  - each piece of armour contributes to coverage cumulatively
whenever an attemp is made to bypass armour, coverage is the primary statistic governing success
  - the attack must hit in order for the bypass technique to work (ie cannot be dodged, blocked or parried)
  - weapon crossection/size is relevant, for instance, axes require large gaps in order to bypass


slash   
stab    
smash   


flexibility 1.0:10.0
  - measures how the armour transmits force to the wearer
  - 10.0 totally flexible, if an attack does not penetrate the armour, then 100% of the force is transmitted to the wearer
    in the form of blunt damage
  - 1.0 totally inflexible, if the attakc does not penetrate the armour, then the force is transmitted to the wearer, but
    mitigated by being spread over the entire surface area of the armour

toughness
  - measure of the energy the armour can absorb per unit area before failure (cracking, shattering, breaking, etc)
  - if an attack beats toughness value of armour, it penetrates


Armour Penetration
 when an attack penetrates, there are several effects
  - debuff to armour coverage, depending on attack
  - inflict a wound on the target


Status Effects

off-balance
  character is off-balance 









abilities

sunder armour
quickdraw

Flinch
cheapshot - target a vulnerable body part (shins, groin, face) in an effort to put an opponent off-balance
shove     - attack by ramming opponent, pushing him back and potentially putting him off-balance
powerful swing - powerful attack which does extra damage, which if block, trips an opponent



STATUS EFFECTS
offguard - opponent is not in a position to defend against incoming attack
sleep    - 
confuse  - 

Attack Action
 - combat dict




Damage System

Damage Types
  slash  
  stab   
  slam

First Pass
  - numeric damage system
  - weapons 
  - 

Second Pass
  - Damage dependent on area attacked


Armour
 - flexibility
   - how the material transmits force through it
   - high flexibility means little protection from crushing damage
 - toughness
   - how much energy the material can resist before rupture per unit area
   - high toughness means the armour is difficult to penetrate

Weapons
 - mass
 - reach
 - basedamage - enlieu of blade type


Hit
 - once an attack scores a hit
   - armour interaction
     - how much energy does the armour absorb
   - damage interaction
     - of

attacker continues to attack until decides to stop, or he runs out of energy
leftover energy is what is available for defense


1 attacker attacks
2 defender defends
  if defends fails
3 armour coverage
4 armour penetration


DISTANCE AND REACH
distance: between you and your target
reach: the effective length of your weapon

you must be within striking distance of your opponent in order to execute a melee attack


priority
a character has priority over another if he is within his opponent's minimum weapon range AND his 
weapon's minimum range is less than his opponent's, or if your opponent is within range of your
weapon, but you are outside of his.
example
  Attacker Gary is wielding a buckler and short swort is up against a Defender Don dual wielding a
  longsword. The two square off, and Don automatically has priority: his longsword outranges 
  Gary's short sword. Gary is in a bad spot, since any attempt to attack he makes suffers a 
  penalty to energy, making it easy for Don to defend against his attacks. Meanwhile, Don can 
  attack at no penalty. Gary knows that in order to win this fight, he will have to win priority
  first, so he uses a weapon attack skill (3). Gary lunges forward, slapping at Don's sword with
  his buckler while simultaneously striking at Don's neck with his short sword. The gambit works,
  and Don is unable to defend against the attack. Thankfully, Don's chainmail coif protect him
  from the blow to his neck, but Don loses priority to Gary.
  Don, aware of priority rules himself, now finds the tables turned, and the advantage of his 
  longsword reduced to a disadvantage. Don could try the same gambit that just worked against him,
  but Gary's dual sword/shield combo make success extremely unlikely. Gary opts to change stances
  at a cost of (1), and enters into *half-sword stance*. This reduces the effective range of his
  longsword, but also reduces the minimum range and priority is equalized.
  He is still at a disadvantage against Gary's sword shield combo in terms of available skills,
  but at least he will not suffer an energy penalty when attemting an attack.
